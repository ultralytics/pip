# Ultralytics pip Package Template

This is a minimal template repository for reserving Python package names on PyPI and deploying v0.0.0 placeholders. It provides a streamlined way to ensure that your package name is available for future development and releases.

## What is this repository for?

- **Name Reservation**: Ensures the package name you desire is reserved on PyPI.
- **Placeholder Deployment**: Allows for an initial v0.0.0 release to indicate the package name is taken but the package is not yet functional.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/pip.git <your-package-name>
```

### Step 2: Update Package Information

Edit the `setup.py` file to update the package name, author, and other meta-information.

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

If your package has dependencies, install them.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Package and Upload

Package your code and upload it to PyPI.

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```

Now your package name is reserved and a v0.0.0 placeholder is deployed on PyPI.

## Recommendations

- Once you start the actual development, replace this README with one that describes your package's functionality.
- Add a `LICENSE` file appropriate for your project.
- Update the `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` as your project evolves.
